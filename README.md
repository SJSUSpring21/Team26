**Idea #4: Film Script IMDB Predictor** 

Amateur/aspiring screenwriters have a difficult time getting their scripts criticed and read. This application is intended to give a film script, a IMDB score and scripts that are most similar to it that have already in the IMDB database based on it's similiarity to films. So screenwriters have a slight insight into how their scripts compare to works already out there and gain inspiration from similiar works. The current approach to this problem is to vectorize the script and then run k-nearest neighbor to find k most similar film scripts and average their IMDB scores for a score prediction.

**Input:** Script text file

**Output:** an IMDB prediction score and 5(10,20?) Films with similar scripts
