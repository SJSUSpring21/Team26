Idea #1 :Music Recommendation System


Recommends music as per user's genre preference. Also recommends good music to users looking at their music search patterns. The personalized music recommender supports the user-favorite songs stored in a huge music database. The system can classify a wide range of stored music using automatic music content analyses. Users can opt for music according to their mood, using such words as "bright", "exciting", "quiet", "sad" and "healing".


**Idea #2:Predicting IMDb ratings of the new upcoming movies**

**Introduction**
IMDb Predictor will help new producers/script writers to get a rough idea how their movie will fare in the box-office. A bad film could bring young budding film directors to bankrupcy if their film does not fare at the box office. IMDb predictor will help such budding producers/script writers to play safe.
Target audience: Script writers or film producers
Goal: To give accurate IMDb rating prediction before the movie hits the box-office.

**Abstract:**
Amateur directors/script-writers can upload their movie information like:
budget,actors,director and length of the movieÂ to our IMDb prediction model in order to get an accurate prediction of their movie will fare in the box office. We will use the IMDb dataset to make accurate predictions.






**Idea #3**
Dynamic Pricing for theatre tickets using Machine Learning

**Introduction:**
Dynamic pricing is the practice of adjusting a price to meet its demand, or market value.
Target audience: New/ Small movie theatres looking for increase in sales.
Goal: To help the cinema theatres set competitive prices as per latest industry trends/standards


**Abstract:**
Dynamic pricing is the practice of setting a price for movie tickets after scrutinizing current market conditions. In the blooming era of Netflix, Amazon Prime and Sony Liv, cinema halls are losing out their revenue. Dynamic Pricing can be an efficient way to attract audiences back to cinema halls as was the trend 10 years back when there was no Netflix, Amazon Prime and Sony Liv.
