# **Helping Critic**

## **Introduction:**
IMDb Predictor will help new producers/script writers to get a rough idea how their movie will fare in the box-office. A bad film could bring young budding film directors to bankrupcy if their film does not fare at the box office. IMDb predictor will help such budding producers/script writers to play safe.
Target audience: Script writers or film producers
Goal: To give accurate IMDb rating prediction before the movie hits the box-office.**

## **Abstract:**
Amateur directors/script-writers can upload their movie information like:
budget,actors,director and length of the movieÂ to our IMDb prediction model in order to get an accurate prediction of their movie will fare in the box office. We will use the IMDb dataset to make accurate predictions.

## **Aproach:**
We plan on vectorizing script/screenplays by their word usage that have released into the public as a dataset. Users will input their screenplay as a text-file and then we will run a clustering algorithm to get the most similiar screenplays to it. We will then use the most similar screenplays to it to generate an average IMDb score based on the IMDb scores of the films most close to it.

>**Input:** Screenplay Text File

>**Output:** IMDb Predication Score & 10 Most Similar Screenplays

## **Persona:**
Amateur directors/script-writers 

## **Dataset:**
We will get our dataset from online database such as **SimplyScript** & **IMSDb**
